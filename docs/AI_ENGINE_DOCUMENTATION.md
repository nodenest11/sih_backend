## 🔧 AI Models Implementation

### 1. Rule-Based Geofencing ⚡ (Instant Response)

**Purpose**: Immediate detection of restricted zone violations
**Type**: Deterministic, rule-based
**Response Time**: < 100ms

#### How It Works:
```python
def check_geofence(latitude, longitude):
    # Point-in-polygon check for all active zones
    for zone in restricted_zones:
        if point_inside_polygon((lat, lon), zone.coordinates):
            return {
                "violation": True,
                "zone_name": zone.name,
                "danger_level": zone.danger_level,
                "immediate_alert": True
            }
    return {"violation": False}
```

#### Features:
- **GeoJSON polygon support** for precise boundaries
- **Danger level scoring** (1-5 scale)
- **Buffer zone detection** with configurable radius
- **Instant alerts** with zero ML processing delay

#### Safety Score Impact:
- **Restricted Zone**: -30 points
- **High Danger Zone**: -40 points  
- **Safe Zone Bonus**: +5 to +15 points

### 2. Isolation Forest 🌲 (Anomaly Detection)

**Purpose**: Detect unusual movement patterns and behaviors
**Type**: Unsupervised Machine Learning
**Training**: Continuous (every hour)

#### Algorithm Configuration:
```python
IsolationForest(
    contamination=0.1,     # Expect 10% anomalies
    n_estimators=100,      # 100 decision trees
    random_state=42,       # Reproducible results
    max_features=1.0       # Use all features
)
```

#### Feature Engineering:
```python
features = [
    'distance_per_minute',     # Speed indicator
    'inactivity_duration',     # Stationary time
    'deviation_from_route',    # Route adherence
    'speed_variance',          # Speed consistency
    'location_density',        # Area familiarity
    'zone_risk_score',         # Current area safety
    'time_of_day_risk',        # Temporal risk factor
    'movement_consistency'     # Behavioral consistency
]
```

#### How It Works:
1. **Feature Extraction**: Calculate movement patterns from location history
2. **Anomaly Scoring**: Each location gets anomaly score (0-1)
3. **Threshold Detection**: Scores > 0.7 trigger warnings
4. **Continuous Learning**: Model retrains with new data every hour

#### Example Anomalies Detected:
- Tourist moving at 80+ km/h (likely in vehicle trouble)
- 3+ hours of complete inactivity in unknown area
- Sudden deviation from planned route
- Unusual movement patterns (erratic speed/direction changes)

#### Safety Score Impact:
- **High Anomaly (0.8-1.0)**: -25 points
- **Medium Anomaly (0.5-0.8)**: -15 points
- **Low Anomaly (0.3-0.5)**: -5 points

### 3. Temporal Analysis 📊 (Sequence Modeling)

**Purpose**: Analyze movement sequences over time for gradual risk detection
**Type**: Autoencoder-based sequence analysis
**Window Size**: Last 10 location points

#### Implementation Approach:
```python
class TemporalAnalyzer:
    def __init__(self, window_size=10):
        self.window_size = window_size
        self.sequence_scaler = MinMaxScaler()
        
    def analyze_sequence(self, locations):
        # Create sequence features
        sequence_features = self.extract_sequence_features(locations)
        
        # Calculate reconstruction error (simplified autoencoder)
        normal_pattern = self.get_normal_pattern(tourist_id)
        deviation_score = self.calculate_deviation(sequence_features, normal_pattern)
        
        return {
            "temporal_risk_score": deviation_score,
            "pattern_deviation": deviation_score,
            "confidence": min(len(locations) / self.window_size, 1.0)
        }
```

#### Sequence Features:
- **Movement Velocity**: Speed changes over time
- **Direction Changes**: Heading variations
- **Stop Patterns**: Frequency and duration of stops
- **Route Consistency**: Adherence to typical patterns
- **Temporal Patterns**: Time-based movement analysis

#### Risk Indicators:
- **Gradual Route Deviation**: Slowly moving away from safe areas
- **Increasing Inactivity**: Progressive reduction in movement
- **Erratic Behavior**: Inconsistent movement patterns
- **Time-based Risks**: Movement during unsafe hours

#### Safety Score Impact:
- **High Temporal Risk (0.8-1.0)**: -20 points
- **Medium Temporal Risk (0.5-0.8)**: -12 points  
- **Low Temporal Risk (0.3-0.5)**: -5 points

### 4. Future: Supervised Classification 🎓 (Learning from History)

**Purpose**: Learn from historical incident data for better prediction
**Type**: Supervised Machine Learning (LightGBM/XGBoost)
**Status**: Ready for implementation when labeled data is available

#### Planned Features:
- **Incident History Learning**: Train on past emergency/safe situations
- **Severity Classification**: Predict LOW/MEDIUM/HIGH/CRITICAL risk levels
- **Personalized Models**: Tourist-specific risk profiles
- **Contextual Intelligence**: Weather, events, local conditions

## 🔀 Safety Score Fusion Algorithm

The final safety score combines all model outputs using a weighted approach:

### Score Calculation:
```python
def calculate_final_safety_score(geofence, anomaly, temporal):
    base_score = 100  # Perfect safety
    
    # Apply penalties
    if geofence['violation']:
        base_score -= (geofence['danger_level'] * 8)  # 8-40 points
    
    base_score -= (anomaly['score'] * 25)      # 0-25 points  
    base_score -= (temporal['risk_score'] * 20) # 0-20 points
    
    # Speed penalties
    if location['speed'] > 80:  # km/h
        base_score -= 30
    elif location['speed'] > 60:
        base_score -= 15
    
    # Ensure bounds
    return max(0, min(100, base_score))
```

### Severity Classification:
- **SAFE** (80-100): Continue normal activities
- **WARNING** (50-79): Stay alert, avoid risky areas
- **CRITICAL** (0-49): Immediate action required

### Confidence Calculation:
```python
confidence = mean([
    geofence['confidence'],     # 1.0 (rule-based)
    anomaly['confidence'],      # 0.5-0.95 (model dependent)
    temporal['confidence']      # 0.3-1.0 (data dependent)
])
```
